# Deputy-code
Deputy code challenge

- I created this solution using .net C#(An object oriented programming language).
- One can run the code from visual studio 2019 or visual studio code. Alternatively, root the folder in command prompt/terminal and use 'dotnet build', 'dotnet run' commands to build and run the project(.NET SDK should be installed prior to this)
